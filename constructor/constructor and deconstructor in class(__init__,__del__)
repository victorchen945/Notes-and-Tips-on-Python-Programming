---we have constructor and deconstructor in class, each class ONLY alow one constructor and one deconstructor:
---the constructor and deconstructor don't need return values
---the function of constructor is to initialize the class while the object(class) is instantiated(call class)
---the function of deconstructor is to release the RAM while call progress is finished

see the following:
"""

class architecture():
    def __init__(self):
        print "new construction options"
    def __del__(self):
        print "construction complete"
    def work(self):
        print "architect ready, ", "civil engineer ready, ","electric engineer ready"

###when we call the class:

>>>build=architecture()
new construction options
>>>build.work()
architect ready,civil engineer ready, electric engineer ready
>>>del build
construction complete

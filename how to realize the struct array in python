"""
we know that there 's way to realize struct array in C++ like this:

struct project
{   char architect[30];
    char civilengineer[30];
    char electricengineer[30];
    int days;
    double cost;
    char tel[30];
} projects[100]

while in python we don't have system function like struct
but we can realize the struct array by writing a class:

"""

class project:
    def __init__(self):
        self.architect=""
        self.civilengineer=""
        self.electircengineer=""
        self.days=0
        self.cost=0.00
        self.tel=""

#then we construct list:

project=project()
projects=[]
for i in range(100):
    projects.append(project)

"""but there is the risk, the risk is that every time i call the project it will initialize because we have __init__
thus it may comes like that:

>>>num=2
>>>for j in range(5):
>>>     num+=2
>>>     project[j].days=num
>>>for k in range(5):
>>>     print project[k].days
0 0 0 0 0

#while we expected to get -> 4 6 8 10 12
#that is because everytime we visit project, it will init and set project.days value to 0
